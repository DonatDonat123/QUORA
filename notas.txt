IDEAS 
=================================
-->There are more interesting things you can do if you allow external corpus. For instance, one could upsample non-duplicates using unrelated sentences (or even questions from a StackOverflow/Reddit/Wiki dump). Does this fit in the scope of using external data? If not, one could even use pre-trained embeddings to generate (non-)duplicate question pairs. If not, one can train custom embeddings to detect non-duplicates from a corpus.
AND A WHOLE LIST OF CORPUSES IN https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-question-pairs/discussion/30286

There are duplicate pairs of question-answer in the training set and between training and test set. (https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-question-pairs/discussion/30435)

Is the dataset for the competition the same as for Kaggle? https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-question-pairs/discussion/30257
