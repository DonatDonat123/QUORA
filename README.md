# About Simple Neural Network + LSTM

## Execute first Helper Files + BOW at the Bottom
## Then from Top to Bottom

## I added an LSTM layer for each question before merging them, note the fast overfitting after the 2nd epoch already.
## I had only 64 LSTM-units and a small train-set though, so maybe with more units and the whole train-set it will be better...
